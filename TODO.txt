Android:

- test extensively udp

- icons !

- reduce message sizes by using protobuf for instance ?

- plenty other stuff I guess ....

Windows:

- Try again to move most of the code into a service, and have a minimalist gui-based app which allows to move/click the cursor.
As a result it would be more automatic to run the app on Windows.

Other:

- Linux support ?
